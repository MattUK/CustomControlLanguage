CustomControlLanguage
=====================

A basic-like, 'simple' control language made in Java for a school project.

Designed to work with the Velleman K8085 Control/Interface board, the language is based around an
in-built editor (I would say IDE, but it is not so feature complete). The language itself is a strange
mix of basic and modern languages with concepts such as functions which return values, arrays, etc.

Includes a hand-written tokenizer (lexer) and parser, which probably contain many, many bugs.
